# Customize this file to obtain a workflow definition

# The 1st step has to use a fixed format:

-
    type: workflow
    signal: A_signal_name_here # See the complete list at https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP/Signals+reference
    #run_as: admin # Optional. If not set or false, the workflow will execute as the current user. If set, as the user specified here
    #transaction: false # Optional. If set to true, the whole workflow will execute within a database transaction
    #avoid_recursion: false # Optional. If set to true, the workflow will not trigger when the signal is generated by another workflow

# All other workflow steps follow the syntax of migration steps from the migration bundle

-
    type: some_migration_step...
    mode: create/load/update/delete/etc...
    etc: etc...
